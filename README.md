# Apollo
Apollo is planned to be a desktop app for listening to locally downloaded music. As of now it's not usable and is during development. Created using NextJS 13 and Tauri

## Getting started
The project uses NextJS 13 App directory. The code for the frontend is located in the "src" folder, and the code for the backend is in the "src-tauri" folder.
